# Mode-of-Transport
The project involved deciding on the mode of transport that the employees prefer while commuting to office. 
For this, I utilized multiple models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression to explore the data and to check model performance metrics. 
Bagging and Boosting modeling procedures were also applied to create the models.

The goal is to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign. 

The dataset has data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). 
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
