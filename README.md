# Mode-of-Transport
The project involved deciding on the mode of transport that the employees prefer while commuting to office. 
For this, I utilized multiple models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression to explore the data and to check model performance metrics. 
Bagging and Boosting modeling procedures were also applied to create the models.
